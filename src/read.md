# CODE IN THIS FILE IS DEPRECATED
Be careful using generatedata.py, it only works on THIS branch. Changes to normalize data have been made in the main branch which makes it incompatible. If you really want to use generatedata.py with the files in
main branch, call the NormalizeWatershed augmentations instead of NormalizeBPS. Better yet though is to use the bps_datamodule in main.
